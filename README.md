# Pokedex - A digital Lab Notebook Solution for High Throughput Synthetic Projects
A spin off from the 'Professor Oak' repo, the Pokedex aims to create a directory for storing chemical samples as well as analytical data as they are synthesized.

## Aims:
 - Include a list of samples that each link to an individual page detailing synthetic conditions and data associated with them.
 - Filter by synthesized compound
 - Filter by multiple conditions (drop down menu??)
 - Allow disply of either plotted data in display for (.jpg, .pdf, etc.) or allow raw data to be uploaded and plotted in matplot lib.

  ### Thoughts:
    - It sounds like each sample should be a glorified iPython notebook. Would this be easier???
